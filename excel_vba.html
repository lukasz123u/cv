      <p class="description">It was about 2 years ago when I decided to use
        <strong>V</strong>isual <strong>B</strong>asic for <strong>A</strong>pplication on my own. I remember seeing
        my colleague monitor looking over his shoulder.
        There was an Excel with row highlighting.
        It seemed so lucid to read that
        I wanted to do it instantly on my computer.
        After some time I found it was obvious to have it.
        There is an internet and someone had to do it before.
        You can find a solutions at<a class="ex_link"

        But I preferred to have a book. So I bought one.
        The code is very similar:
      </p>
      <code>
        <textarea class="my_code" name="code1" rows="10" cols="60" spellcheck="false">
Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)

  Cells.Interior.ColorIndex = xlNone
    With ActiveCell
        .EntireRow.Interior.Color = RGB(242, 221, 142)
        .EntireColumn.Interior.Color = RGB(242, 221, 142)
    End With

End Sub
        </textarea>

        The only problem may be the lack of undoing your action.
        But really it was it. Now I use it all the time.
        It was the beginning...
